Basic Unix Commands

 whoami -this command gives the user Information
 id -printing the user Id
 passwd – change user password
 who - gives loggin related information of the system
 last - gives the history of last logged in information

Unix File Operations
 ls -It list files and directories(folders)
 cp -for copy files
 rm -removes the files from the directory or system
 mv – rename or move files and directories to another location
 chmod – change file/directory access permissions
 
Unix Directories Managing Commands
 cd - to change from one directory to other directory
 pwd - confirms or we can check in which directory we are in the current state
 mkdir -is used to create a directory
 rmdir -is used to remove the directory
 
Main Features of Unix
 ctrl+c -This command terminates the currently running foreground process.
 ctrl+z -This command suspends the currently running foreground process to the background
 ctrl+d -This command terminates the currently running login or terminal session.
 clear -clears all commands,results whatsoever on terminal will be erased
 touch -uses to create new files in the directories
 
Grep command in Unix:
 -c: This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
 -h: Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames.
 –i: Ignores, case for matching
 -l: Displays list of a filenames only.
 -n: Display the matched lines and their line numbers.
 -v: This prints out all the lines that do not matches the pattern
 -e : Specifies expression with this option. Can use multiple times.
 -f file: Takes patterns from file, one per line.
 -o :Print only the matched parts of a matching line, with each such part on a
 separate output line.
 
Sed Command in Unix:
 SED is a powerful text stream editor. Can do insertion, deletion,
 search and replace(substitution).
 SED command in unix supports regular expression which allows it
 perform complex pattern matching.
 
 $sed 's/unix/linux/' geekfile.txt  // command to replace the text from the file
 $sed 's/unix/linux/2' geekfile.txt // command used to replace the nth occurance in the given file txt

Sort Command:

 -o: Specifies an output file for the sorted data. 
 Functionally equivalent to redirecting output to a file.
 -r: Sorts data in reverse order (descending).
 -n: Sorts a file numerically (interprets data as numbers).
 -nr: Sorts a file with numeric data in reverse order.
 Combines -n and -r options.
 -k: Sorts a table based on a specific column number.
 -c: Checks if the file is already sorted and reports any
 disorder.

AWK command in Unix:

 $awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt  //Print the lines which match the given pattern.
 
 $awk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt //Use of NR built-in variables (Display Line Number)
 
 
 My practice on ubuntu terminal
 rgukt-basar@captain-america:~$ cat> student.txt
ramsingh id b200003
nagaraju is b201136
ramu id b201436
rgukt-basar@captain-america:~$ awk '/is/{print}' student.txt
